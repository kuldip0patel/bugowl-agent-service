      label: "What is your proposed solution?"
      description: |
        Describe the ideal specific solution you'd want, *and whether it fits into any broader scope of changes*.
      placeholder: |
        e.g. I want to add a default controller action that can hover/drag the mouse on a path when given a series of x,y coordinates.
        More broadly it may be useful add a computer-use x,y-coordinate style automation fallback method that can do complex mouse interaction tasks.

      description: |
        A description of any alternative approaches, workarounds, or other solutions you've considered to fix the problem.
      placeholder: |
        e.g. I tried upgrading to the latest version and telling it to hover in the prompt. I also tried telling the agent
        to ask for human help (using a custom controller action) when it gets to this step, then I manually click a browser extension
        called "XYZ Mouse" that I have installed in the profile that automates the mouse movevement.
