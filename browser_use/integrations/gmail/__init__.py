Gmail Integration for Browser Use
Provides Gmail API integration for handling 2FA codes and email reading.
This integration enables agents to authenticate via email when 2FA is required.
Usage:
    from browser_use.integrations.gmail import GmailService, register_gmail_actions
    # Option 1: Register Gmail actions with file-based authentication
    controller = Controller()
    register_gmail_actions(controller)
    # Option 2: Register Gmail actions with direct access token (recommended for production)
    controller = Controller()
    register_gmail_actions(controller, access_token="your_access_token_here")
    # Option 3: Use the service directly
    gmail = GmailService(access_token="your_access_token_here")
    await gmail.authenticate()
    codes = await gmail.find_2fa_codes()
